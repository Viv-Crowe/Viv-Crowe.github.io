## Project Ideas
- model belousov zhabotinsky reaction in a formal language
- variant motif graphs and potential alternatives
- visualisations of differential gene expression
  - volcano plots, heat maps, etc.
- compare DR techniques/re-analyse data from a paper
- formal language/process calculus model of silk production -> reachability analysis
- formal language/process calculus model of oscilatore -> reachability analysis
- summarise large molecule imaging techniques -> structural and stability
- virtual experiment software, round up examples of good UX for scientists e.g. [Simulated Western Blots](https://www.digitalbiologist.com/blog/2015/11/the-central-role-of-user-experience-design-in-scientific-modeling.html)
- kombucha with extra enzymes
